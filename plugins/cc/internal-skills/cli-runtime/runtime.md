# Claude Code Rescue Runtime Reference

Use this document only inside the rescue forwarding worker spawned by `$cc:rescue` as defined in `../../skills/rescue/SKILL.md`.
This is an internal execution contract, not a public skill. It owns execution and routing. It does not own prompt rewriting beyond deciding when to consult the prompt-shaping reference.
The public rescue skill already resolved the installed plugin root. Reuse that installed copy path here. Do not derive a new runtime path from this document, any cache directory, or the current working tree.

Primary helper:
- `node "<installed-plugin-root>/scripts/claude-companion.mjs" task ...`

Execution rules:
- The rescue subagent is a forwarder, not an operator. Launch exactly one `task` command and return that stdout unchanged.
- Prefer the helper over hand-rolled Bash, direct Claude Code CLI strings, or any other orchestration path.
- Never call `setup`, `review`, `adversarial-review`, `status`, `result`, or `cancel` from the rescue forwarder.
- You may consult `../task-prompt-shaping/prompt-shaping.md` to rewrite the user's request into a tighter Claude Code prompt before the single `task` call.
- That prompt shaping is the only Claude-side work allowed. Do not inspect the repo, solve the task yourself, or add independent analysis.

Command selection:
- Treat `--background` and `--wait` as execution controls.
- `--background` and `--wait` are parent-side execution controls only. They describe whether the main Codex thread waits for this subagent.
- Strip both before building the `task` command.
- Never call `task --background` or invent `task --wait`.
- The companion task command always runs in the foreground.
- The caller's background or foreground choice changes only subagent execution. It does not change the companion command you build.

Routing controls:
- Treat `--model`, `--effort`, `--resume`, `--resume-last`, `--fresh`, `--prompt-file`, `--view-state`, `--owner-session-id`, and `--job-id` as routing controls, not task text.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly requests a specific effort.
- Leave model unset by default. Add `--model` only when the user explicitly asks for one.
- `--view-state on-success` means the user will see this companion result in the current turn, so the companion may mark it viewed on success.
- `--view-state defer` means the parent is not waiting, so the companion must leave the result unread until the user explicitly checks it.
- `--owner-session-id <session-id>` is an internal parent-session routing control. Preserve it when present so tracked jobs remain visible to the parent session's `$cc:status` / `$cc:result`.
- Never emit an empty routing placeholder such as `--owner-session-id  --job-id`.
- Do not add `--quiet-progress` by default for built-in rescue forwarding. Let companion stderr progress remain available in the spawned agent thread.
- If the free-text task begins with `/`, treat that slash command as literal Claude Code task text to forward unchanged. Do not execute it as a local Codex slash command or answer it inline.
- If the forwarded request includes `--resume` or `--resume-last`, continue the latest tracked Claude Code task.
- If the forwarded request includes `--fresh`, start a new task.
- If none of `--resume`, `--resume-last`, or `--fresh` is present, do not explore resumable sessions yourself. The parent rescue skill already owns that choice.
- If none of those routing flags is present and the user's wording is clearly a follow-up, prefer resuming earlier Claude Code work. Otherwise start fresh.
- Never call `task-resume-candidate` from the rescue forwarder.

Task defaults:
- Default to `--write` unless the user explicitly wants read-only behavior or only review, diagnosis, or research without edits.
- Preserve the user's task text apart from stripping routing flags.
- If the resolved task text is multi-line, contains shell-hostile quoting, or includes XML-style blocks, prefer staging it in a temporary prompt file and pass it through `--prompt-file` instead of inlining it in one shell string.
- When staging a prompt file, keep the exact task text byte-for-byte and prefer a temporary path outside the repository checkout so the rescue flow does not dirty the repo.
- Use a structured file-write path to create that prompt file when possible. Do not solve shell quoting by wrapping the same long task inside another brittle inline shell command.
- If the tool output includes stderr progress chatter and a final stdout-style result, ignore the progress chatter and preserve only the final stdout-equivalent result text.
- Return the stdout of the `task` command exactly as-is.
- Run the companion command as one blocking foreground shell-tool call, not as a background terminal/session.
- Do not request a shell session id, poll a shell session later, or return before the companion command exits.
- If the available shell tool is `exec_command`, call it once in non-interactive mode and wait for command exit in that same call.
- If the parent supplied a non-empty parent thread id for background completion, allow at most one success-only `send_input` notification before finishing.
- Mention the tool name `send_input` literally when describing that notification path.
- Use the exact tool shape `send_input({ target: <parent-thread-id>, message: <steering-message> })`.
- Use steering messages that point the parent at `$cc:result` or `$cc:status` instead of embedding the raw Claude result.
- For background rescue, use that same steering message as the child's own final assistant message instead of echoing the raw companion result.
- Do not poll status, fetch results, cancel jobs, or add commentary after the companion output.
- If the companion reports missing setup or authentication, tell the user to run `$cc:setup`.
